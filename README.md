# Pi-hole Whitelist
This repository contains a list of domains you might want to allow after adding your block lists.
The domains are already formatted into a command, ready to be applied to your Pi-hole.

I will never knowingly add advertising or tracking domains and I always do my best to test the domains to make sure they're actually necessary or useful.
Unfortunatly that doesn't rule out the possiblity that a domain is tracking you while providing you a useful service. If it's really important to you, you can always hand pick the services or domains you want to add.

I'm fine with receiving suggestions/requests, but I ultimately decide if I add one to the list. I won't add domains that could be used to track, domains that are not possible (or too difficult) for me to test, or that I deem inappropriate, illegal, not useful, unsafe.
