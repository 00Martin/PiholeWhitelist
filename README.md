# Pi-hole Whitelist
This repository contains a list of domains you might want to allow after adding your block lists.
The domains are already formatted into a command, ready to be applied to your Pi-hole.

I will never knowingly add advertising* or tracking** domains and I always do my best to test the domains to make sure they're actually necessary or useful.
Unfortunatly that doesn't rule out the possiblity that a domain is tracking you while providing you a useful service. If it's really important to you, you can always hand pick the services or domains you want to add.

I'm fine with receiving suggestions/requests, but I ultimately decide if I add one to the list. I won't add domains that could be used to track, domains that are not possible (or too difficult) for me to test, or that I deem inappropriate, illegal, not useful, unsafe.

*At the exception of Brave Rewards from Brave Browser. It's open source, built around privacy, provides legitimate value, and can be fully disabled.
**At the exception of telemetry for PlayStation and Xbox. Personal data is stored in your service account (PSN/Live) anyway, and in the case of PlayStation if telemetry is blocked the console won't upload information like your game time, or game sessions (used for PS stars).

Trademarks go to their respective owners, I am not affiliated with any of the brands, domains or companies listed.
